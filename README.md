Hi there!
I'm a software developer with a passion for building applications and solving problems. Some of the technologies I've worked with include C++, JAVA, C, and React. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies and tools, or collaborating with other developers on open source projects.

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat or collaborate!
